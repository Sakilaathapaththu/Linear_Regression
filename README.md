# Linear_Regression
This DSA (Data Science and Analysis) module covers two fundamental regression techniques: Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression. Simple Linear Regression analyzes the relationship between two variables, typically a dependent and an independent variable, to make predictions. Multiple Linear Regression extends this concept to include multiple independent variables, enhancing predictive modeling capabilities. These techniques are essential tools for understanding and modeling relationships in data.
